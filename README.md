# Elective Destinations Reporting

This repository contains scripts which report against Oxford University Medical Sciences' Feedback System.

These reports show where medics go on their elective placements. 

Uses [R][1] and SQL (MySQL variant). Outputs to CSV and [Leaflet][2] (HTML5 + Javascript)

Unfortunately I can't show the data and so there's not output.
